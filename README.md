# Chess

## Overview
This Chess game is a comprehensive C++ project that simulates a chessboard and chess pieces, allowing for gameplay, move validation, and state management. It includes detailed implementation of each chess piece and the board, as well as utilities for managing the game's state.

## Features
- Object-oriented design with a class for each type of chess piece and the chessboard.
- Functionality for checking valid moves, game state, and turn management.
- UML diagram (`chessUML.pdf`) detailing the project's design and structure.
- Test cases and automated tests for validating game logic and moves.
- Persistence for saving and loading game states.

## Files
- Source files (`*.cpp`): Implementations of chess pieces (`Bishop`, `King`, `Knight`, `Pawn`, `Queen`, `Rook`), the board, and game management.
- Header files (`*.h`): Declarations for all classes and utilities used throughout the game.
- `main.cpp`: The entry point of the application, tying together all game components.
- `Makefile`: Automates the build process, making compilation straightforward.
- `chessUML.pdf`: Visual representation of the project's architecture.
- Directories `test_cases`, `valid_moves`, `invalid_moves`, `loading_saving`, and `output_dump` contain test scripts and data for various testing and gameplay scenarios.
